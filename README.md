# Patch Github New Pull Request Redirect

This is a TamperMonkey script that patches the new pull request links so then don't go against an upstream repo by default.

In response to https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/11729#discussioncomment-7735798

## TODO

- [ ] add a bunch of tests.
- [ ] figure out how to serve as an easy to install script
